# SLIngo_Sign_Interpreter_App
Sign language to text interpreter built with CNNs and deployed on Android
SLIngo is a mobile application that translates sign language gestures into text using a CNN-based deep learning model. Designed to aid communication for the hearing and speech-impaired community, SLIngo uses real-time image recognition and on-device processing.

**Project goal** is to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers by translating hand gestures into readable text using machine learning and real-time image processing.
